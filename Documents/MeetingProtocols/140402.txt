1. Objectives (5 min) 
	Change everything so that we use render to update
	the game instead of each part controlling time by itself.
	
2. Reports (15 min) 
	No coding have been done but we are allowed to use render
	to control the game so that some classes needs to be changed. 
	We have some images that we want to put in the game now for towers and enemies.
	
3. Discussion items (35 min)
	Shall Map have a update method?
	Yes it will move all monsters and let towers shoot.
	Some of the code from EnemyView needs to be moved to AbstractEnemy to allow 
	movement with the update method.
	Replace with tiledMapLayer for Abstract enemy.
	Fix wave. 
	Tower.shoot needs to be reworked to work with update
	
4. Outcomes and assignments (5 min)
