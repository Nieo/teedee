  Date:140508

  Facilitator:Jacob Genander

  Participants:David Michaëlsson, Erik Pihl, Daniel Jansson

1. Objectives (5 min) Resolve any issues preventing the team to
  continue (this should be possible to verify at next meeting,
  short clear description, use issues from project site).

	a. Need more code to reach the goal (750 rows/person)
	b. Need more tests to verify that the code is working properly.

2. Reports (15 min) From previous meetings, (un)solved issues,
  etc. , see also 4
	Stuff is now being drawn at the right places.
	The aim issue for towers is now solved.
	The enemies are now moving accordingly to their path.
	The documentation is still to be completed.
	Two more enemies and one tower has been made.
	No more maps have been made.

3. Discussion items (35 min)

  (a) How do we efficiently send a value (svårighetsgraden) from MapScreen to Map?
	The problem is that it has to be sent in many steps.

  (b) Why is the class Bullet not in the screen package?

  (c) How should a map be created? Should the paths be created inside a single map instance and then be selected,
	or should the paths be created in a path factory class?

4. Outcomes and assignments (5 min)

  (a) It's decided that a path factory class will be created, and that it can instantiate predefined paths 
	from some sort of path identifiers (i.e. an int). This will be used when creating maps.

  (b) David will implement the path factory class.

  (c) Daniel will make the application window resizable during a game.

  (d) Jacob will continue to write tests. He will also create a ”Game Over” screen.

  (e) Erik will continue to write tests. He will also create a ”Credits” screen.

5. Wrap up

  (a) Follow the plan we’ve just made.

  (b) Next meeting will take place next week.
